- [Writing code for NLP Research](https://github.com/allenai/writing-code-for-nlp-research-emnlp2018/blob/master/writing_code_for_nlp_research.pdf)

## Videos/Courses
* [Machine learning (HUng-yi Lee, NTU)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXgbekl66jc&list=PLJV_el3uVTsPy9oCRY30oBPNLCo89yu49) Very great learning course. Professor Lee is humor and the introduction for the concepts/formula deductions are very easy to understand. You could lean how machine learning works, why it works.
